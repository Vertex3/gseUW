that contain the python and fme tools that perform the processing.

Folders:
batch - the batch update folder that has some multiprocessing tools plus Routing and Exterior line processing that is run in batch mode
config - the gizinta xml files that match source feature classes and attributes to the target data model
fme - the fme workbench files used for processing. The \log subfolder contains the fme log files that are useful for debugging
py - the python folder that contains the sync engine script logic. the \log folder contains python log files that are useful for debugging
scrap - some scrap files
serverConfig - contains xml files that set the folder locations for drawings and other config items. Also contains the .sde connection files used for all processing
views - a folder for view scripts, especially the publication views that are used to join other tables and populate the publication database

Files:

The 2 most important files are Floorplan_exec_all and Routing_exec_all. These 2 batch files run the entire sync process from end to end

Basemap_sync.bat - script to load from siteplan drawings to cadsde
BldgOutline_archive.bat - archive buildings
BldgOutline_sync.bat - Load building outlines from source dwg files to cadsde
Floorplan_archive.bat - archive floorplan drawings
Floorplan_exec_all.bat - run all of the floorplan processing by drawing with sync to publication
Floorplan_sync.bat - Load floorplans from source cad drawings to cadsde
gse.py - some site-level folder structure settings used by other scripts. No need to change this unless the folder structure is changed
gse.tbx - contains several geoprocessing tools used to create difference views and analyze datasets
gseLocal.tbx - some site-specific geoprocessing models that use tools in gse.tbx
Publication_sync.bat - sync floorplan and building data to the publication database (incremental update)
PublicationRouting_sync.bat - sync routing data to the publication database (batch replace)
Routing_ElevatorRebuild_Sync.bat - rebuild all elevators on cadsde
Routing_exec_all.bat - run all of the Routing processes with sync to the nav serverConfig
