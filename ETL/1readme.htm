<strong>Folders:</strong>
<p>batch - the batch update folder that has some multiprocessing tools plus Routing and Exterior line processing that is run in batch mode</p>
<p>config - the gizinta xml files that match source feature classes and attributes to the target data model</p>
<p>fme - the fme workbench files used for processing. The \log subfolder contains the fme log files that are useful for debugging</p>
<p>py - the python folder that contains the sync engine script logic. the \log folder contains python log files that are useful for debugging</p>
<p>scrap - some scrap files</p>
<p>serverConfig - contains xml files that set the folder locations for drawings and other config items. Also contains the .sde connection files used for all processing</p>
<p>views - a folder for view scripts, especially the publication views that are used to join other tables and populate the publication database</p>

<p><strong>Files:</strong></p>

<strong>The 2 most important files are Floorplan_exec_all and Routing_exec_all. These 2 batch files run the entire sync process from end to end</strong>

<p>Basemap_sync.bat - script to load from siteplan drawings to cadsde</p>
<p>BldgOutline_archive.bat - archive buildings</p>
<p>BldgOutline_sync.bat - Load building outlines from source dwg files to cadsde</p>
<p>Floorplan_archive.bat - archive floorplan drawings</p>
<p>Floorplan_exec_all.bat - run all of the floorplan processing by drawing with sync to publication</p>
<p>Floorplan_sync.bat - Load floorplans from source cad drawings to cadsde</p>
<p>gse.py - some site-level folder structure settings used by other scripts. No need to change this unless the folder structure is changed</p>
<p>gse.tbx - contains several geoprocessing tools used to create difference views and analyze datasets</p>
<p>gseLocal.tbx - some site-specific geoprocessing models that use tools in gse.tbx</p>
<p>Publication_sync.bat - sync floorplan and building data to the publication database (incremental update)</p>
<p>PublicationRouting_sync.bat - sync routing data to the publication database (batch replace)</p>
<p>Routing_ElevatorRebuild_Sync.bat - rebuild all elevators on cadsde</p>
<p>Routing_exec_all.bat - run all of the Routing processes with sync to the nav serverConfig</p>
<p>Routing_sync.bat - Load routing drawings from source cad drawings to cadsde</p>
